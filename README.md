# Shopify Data Challenge 

Code, discussion, and solutions for Question 1 can be found in the `shopify.html` file, generated as an output from `shopify.Rmd`.

Solutions for Question2 can also be found in the `shopify.html`. Queries used to arrive at solutions can be found in the `shopify_question2.sql` or `shopify_question2.txt` file.

Looking forward to hearing back and learning more about Shopify!
